# List-of-Ingredients App - Modern Web Stackâ€”Rails 5 API + ActiveAdmin + Create React App on Heroku

Rails 5 app, API-only, serving Create React App client on the front end, with full access to ActiveAdmin.

##App using the following elements:

* Ruby 2.6.5p114 - Rails 5.2.4.1

* Create React App - All the power of a highly-tuned Webpack config without the hassle.

* Rails in API-only mode - Just the best bits, leaving React to handle the UI.

* ActiveAdmin - An instant CMS backend.

* Seamless deployment on Heroku- Same-origin (so no CORS complications) with build steps to manage both Node and Ruby.

* Single page app support with React Router - So you can have lightning fast rendering on the front end.
